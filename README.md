Source code of my solutions to the [hackattic](https://hackattic.com/) challenges.

## Prerequisites

Python >= 3.7.

## Installation

Clone this repo, and then the usual `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Some solutions needs additional PyPI packages to be installed. See source code.

## Configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the configuration parameters which are self-explanatory.

## Usage

Simply execute one of the scripts named after the corresponding problem (e.g `python help_me_unpack.py`). Note that
some may be placed in folders with the same name, for clarity purposes.
